Now setuptools declares its own dependencies in the ``core`` extra. Dependencies are still vendored for bootstrapping purposes, but setuptools will prefer installed dependencies if present. The ``core`` extra is used for informational purposes and should *not* be declared in package metadata (e.g. ``build-requires``). Downstream packagers can de-vendor by simply removing the ``setuptools/_vendor`` directory.
